# ChessPad
PGN editor for Android

The full description can be found in ChessPadApp/src/main/assets/about/ directory

It's possible to build ChessPad without nnue for Stockfish. That will make the program x10 smallaer
at the cost of some SF weakness. For that nnue file has to be removed from assets.
